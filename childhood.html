    <div id="dialogSandbox" title="my sand box">
        <p>we had this reading program when i was in kindergarden where you listed all the books you read and you get prizes depending on how many pages you read. i got this empty box as a prize once and filled it with the sand from those sand kits. the ones where you're supposed to fill glass jars with sand in a pretty pattern. instead of doing that i just mixed all the colors together and put it in the box. literally i don't even know. i even mixed flour in it because i thought it made it softer.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="dialogPixelchick" title="pixel chix">
        <p>i think they were inspired by tamagotchi when they made this. i don't think i ever got to connect it with anyone else. you could connect with other houses and the little characters could visit each other. i think i might have forgotten to play with it so she would always move out because not enough attention.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="dialogFeatherpen" title="feather gel pen">
        <p>my mom got me this pink gel pen with feathers on the end for Christmas and i kind of just used it as a duster for eraser shavings when i didn't want to smudge my drawing.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="dialogTamagotchi" title="tamagotchi">
        <p>the pink one with hearts was the first one i got. i got so obsessed with tamagotchis after that. i made little homes out of cardstock for them and cases out of felt. my favorite one was mimitchi but i never got it. i think i always got masktchi or like kuchipatchiâ€¦</p>
